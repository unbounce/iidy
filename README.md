# iidy (Is it done yet?) -- a CloudFormation CLI tool

(Note: this is written assuming an Unbounce developer is the reader and we
previously used Ansible for orchestrating CloudFormation.)

`iidy` improves the developer experience with CloudFormation.

* It provides immediate, readable feedback about what CloudFormation
  is doing and any errors it encounters.
* Its single binary is simpler to install than Ansible's Python
  dependencies.
* It is far simpler to learn, understand, and use. There are fewer
  moving parts and its commands map directly to CloudFormation's.
* It requires less boilerplate files and directories. 2 or 3 files vs
  5+ directories with 7+ files.
* It has simple, reliable support for AWS profiles.
* It supports the full range of CloudFormation operations, including
  _changesets_ without requiring any code beyond what is required to
  create a stack. Ansible requires additional code/configuration for
  this.
* It does some template validation, guards against common issues, and
  will be extended over time to validate our best practices and
  security policies.
* It provides seemless integration with AWS ParameterStore, our choice
  for secret management going forward and our replacement for Ansible
  Vault.
* It has bash command completion support.

`iidy` also improves the developer experience working with CloudFormation
Yaml templates. It includes an optional yaml pre-processor that:

* allows values to be imported from a range of sources, including
  local files, s3, https, ParameterStore, and environment variables.
  It parses json or yaml imports. The imported data can be stitched
  into the target template as yaml subtrees, as literal strings, or as
  single values.
* can be used to define custom resource templates that expand out
  to a set of real AWS resources. These templates can be parameterized
  and can even do input validation on the parameters. The template
  expansion and validation happens as a pre-process step prior to
  invoking CloudFormation on the rendered output.

## Pronunciation 

iidy is pronounced "eye-dee", like the audience's response to Cab Calloway in Minnie the
Moocher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mq4UT4VnbE&feature=youtu.be&t=50s

## Demo

Here's a comparison between developer experience of `iidy` and `Ansible`
when you run into errors with a CloudFormation stack:

## Installation

### MacOS: Binary Install via Homebrew

Use Unbounce's custom Homebrew Tap to install iidy.  This is the preferred method for macos.

```
brew tap unbounce/homebrew-taps
brew update
brew install iidy
```

### Binary Installation on Other Platforms
```
# Grab the appropriate binary from the releases page.
wget https://github.com/unbounce/iidy/releases/download/v1.6.0-rc6/iidy-linux-amd64.zip
# or wget https://github.com/unbounce/iidy/releases/download/v1.6.0-rc6/iidy-macos-amd64.zip
unzip iidy*.zip
chmod +x iidy
mv iidy /usr/local/bin/   # or somewhere more appropriate
```

### Installation from Source

Counter-intuitively, this requires more disk space than the binary
install. You need Node 7+ and npm 4+ installed.

```
git clone git@github.com:unbounce/iidy.git
cd iidy
npm install . && npm run build # to compile our source first
ln -s $(pwd)/bin/iidy /usr/local/bin/
# or npm install -g .
```

### Using Parameter Store for secrets and ARNs

Here's an example of importing a single secret from Parameter Store.
```
# example stack-args.yaml
$imports:
  dbPasswd: ssm:/staging/lp-webapp/dbPasswd
  # the ssm: prefix ^ is used to ask for a ssm:parameterstore import

StackName: iidy-demo
Template: ./cfn-template.yaml
Parameters:
  DbPasswd: !$ dbPasswd
  ...
```
See below for more on `$imports` and `includes` (i.e. the `!$` yaml tag).


You can also import the full set of parameters under a path prefix:
```
# example stack-args.yaml
$imports:
  secrets: ssm-path:/staging/lp-webapp/
  # ssm-path: prefix ^ grabs all parameters under that path
  # and makes them accessible as a key-value map.

StackName: iidy-demo
Template: ./cfn-template.yaml
Parameters:
  DbPasswd: !$ secrets.dbPasswd
  SomeOtherPasswd: !$ secrets.otherPasswd
  ...
```



## Yaml Pre-Processing
...

### Imports and Includes

```
# Example of stitching in values from another yaml file
$imports:
  # <importName>: <importSource>
  mappings: ./mappings.yaml

Mappings: !$ mappings
```

#### Import Source Options

* file
* filehash
* s3
* https
* git
* random
* environment variables
* CloudFormation stacks
* AWS SSM ParameterStore

### Working With CloudFormation Yaml

#### Custom CloudFormation Resource Types
...

### Working with *Non*-CloudFormation Yaml
`iidy` autodetects whether a Yaml document is a CloudFormation
template or not. If it's not, the CloudFormation custom resource
templates described above and some validation/normalization features
are disabled. Everything else should work as described above.

## Examples
See the examples/ directory.


## Development

iidy is coded in Typescript and compiles to es2015 Javascript using
commonjs modules (what Node uses). See the `Makefile` and the script
commands in `package.json` for details about the build process.
